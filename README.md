# Aseprite-XFCE-Theme
A GTK and XFWM4 theme inspired by Aseprite

This was mostly done for a laugh and as a project to learn about CSS and GTK theming. It's far from perfect and probably won't be seeing any more development. An Aseprite-inspired wallpaper is included in the extras folder, as well as a "home" icon I made for the whisker menu button.
